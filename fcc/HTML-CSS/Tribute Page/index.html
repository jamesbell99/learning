          <h2 id="headline">Series 1 Land Rover : A brief history</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>1947</strong> - Land Rover conceived by the Rover Company, during the aftermath of World War II. The first Land Rover was designed as a centre steer, by Maurice Wilks.</li>
              <li><strong>1948</strong> - The first production model, called the "Series 1" is launched at the Amsterdam Motor Show. It was configured with the traditional right-hand drive steering wheel, and was on sale until 1951 with a 80" chassis.</li>
              <li><strong>1952</strong> - A larger 2.0-litre petrol engine is fitted (increasing from the initial 1.6-litre 50 bhp petrol engine).</li>
              <li><strong>1954</strong> - The 80" chassis is replaced with a longer 86" chassis, and a new 107" chassis "pick-up" model is introduced.</li>
              <li><strong>1955</strong> - September 1955 sees the launch of the first 5-door "Station Wagon" variant; capable of seating up to 10 people. A 3-door 86" Station Wagon is also released; capable of seating up to 7 people.</li>
              <li><strong>1956</strong> - The wheelbases were extended by 2" (to 88" and 109") in readiness for a diesel engine variant which was released the following year. These dimensions remained the same for the next 25 years.</li>
              <li><strong>1957</strong> - A brand new 2.0-litre diesel engine is released. Although it was the same size as the petrol engine, it was completely unrelated and was a brand new design. It was also one of the first high-speed diesel engines developed for road use, producing 52 bhp.</li>
              <li><strong>1958</strong> - The Series 1 Land Rover is replaced by the Series 2 Land Rover.</li>
            </ul>
